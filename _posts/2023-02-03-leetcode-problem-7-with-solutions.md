# [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

# Description

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

### Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321

### Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

### Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
 

### Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
